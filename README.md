# Tunnel Vision

Tunnel Vision is a single player arcade shooter made for a 48-hour game jam, with the theme of tunnels.

This game uses the concept of "tunnel vision", where the player becomes so focused on a task that they ignore everything else.

All assets (excluding fonts & some sound samples) were made from scratch.


## Gameplay 

Shoot down enemies, get points! Enemies drop collectables for you to pick up as well, which'll increase your score!

In this particular game, the camera zooms based on your fire rate. If the camera's zoomed all the way, you won't be able to see enemies approaching near you!

This means you'll have to balance between shooting to destroy enemies, and not shooting to see what's near you.

The longer you survive, the more enemies there are. 

### Controls

You control a circle ship with a turret.

Use WASD (or arrow keys!) to move.

Move the mouse to aim.

Shoot with left mouse button.

### Enemies

There are 8 enemies in total, each with their quirk. Some enemies are slow, some enemies are fast, some enemies don't really care too much about you, and some enemies spawn other enemies!

### Game Over

You lose when you run out of health. Amazing. Never seen that mechanic before. What exactly is health again?
